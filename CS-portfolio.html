        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
        In "Bullet HECK" the objective to survive as long as you can by dodging <br>
        every obstacle and using items to your advantage. To increase your <br>
        score, keep staying alive. The "+" power-up adds 10 to your score<br>
        while the "-" power-up subtracts 10. The randomness of this game occurs<br>
        in how the items appear. When the game begins, there is a randomized <br>
        amount of time before each set of items are activated by a broadcast. There <br>
        is also randomization of when and where the items appear after the broadcast. <br>
        The game becomes more difficult the longer the player survive as more <br>
        enemies and items appear. The game ends when the player is hit by an enemy.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <p>
        I made "Bullet HECK" because I was bored and wanted to make a game that <br>
        would be hard for players to win. My inspiration for the game came from <br> 
        games that I have played or have seen including "The Binding of Isaac", <br> 
        "Enter the Gungeon", and "Undertale". I was successful in creating a <br>
        game that would be challenging to beat, withmy average time being only <br>
        about 30 seconds. I was also successful in programming the enemies according <br>
        to my original vision. I was unsuccessful, however, in creating accurate <br>
        hitboxes and a scoring system. With help from Ms. Terry, I managed to create <br>
        a better hitbox system but it is still a little faulty. The scoring system <br>
        I fixed by separating it from the "Time" value. If I had more time, <br>
        I would definitely improve the hitbox system, and maybe add more items<br>
        to spice up the game.
        </p>
        <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
        <p>
        This algorithm, though separated into two, is an important set of <br>
        step-by-step procedures that allow the game enemies to attack the player. <br>
        First, when the sprite receives the broadcast "Shoot1" the sprite <br>
        will appear. Then, it will continuously point towards the player, <br>
        wait 1 second, and create a clone. Once a clone is created, it <br>
        moves 10 steps and shrinks in size by 95%; this will be <br>
        repeated 40 times and afterwards the clone is deleted.

        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>
        Dev.AI is a Choose Your Own Adventure game where you, the player, create<br>
        your own personal AI. You begin by following one of the paths on how to <br>
        train your creation. What follows are some scenarios where you have to make <br>
        choices and depending on the choice, you reach a certain ending.

        <h3>Explanation:</h3>
        </p>
        When collaborating with Manson to create this CYOA game, we began by <br>
        writing each scene in chronological order, and then translating it<br>
        into code as we went along. Whenever we reached a decision point, we <br>
        would code completely one branch before going back and completeting the <br>
        other. At every decision point, I would test whether each choice led to <br>
        the correct scene, and whether it would accept the correct inputs. If <br>
        there were any errors I would correct them and test again to make sure. <br>
        A major problem we ran into was the timing and pacing of the story. <br>
        Originally, the story was moving to slowly for the amount of text we had<br>
        while the decisions would appear to quickly afterwards. To try to resolve <br>
        this, we changed the speeds of typing and the sleep a couple of times before <br>
        we reached a point we believed that was easier on the player. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Organizing each scene into a separate function is a form of procedural <br>
        abstraction becasue it divides the code into smaller portions that would <br>
        only run when it was called upon and considered necessary for progression. <br>
        This reduces the amount of unnecessary code and makes the program more <br>
        efficient to run. Doing so helped our game easier to read, faster to <br>
        play, and less complicated overall to code.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another story that I had found interesting was called "Stranded". It was<br>
        a fairly simple game plot-wise and text-wise but was funny with its <br>
        endings. Honestly, it was a quick and simple game that was nice to play.
